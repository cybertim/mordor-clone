This is a fairly rough clone of the game Mordor: Depths of Dejenol. The project was started with three goals in mind:

1) I really like the original, but am on a mac, so I want a version I can easily play anywhere (hence Java)

2) I am a co-op student, having real projects under my belt looks good (as my last pre-work term demonstrated when I received half a dozen offers). In particular, I have an interest in the game industry. This project allows me to both further develop my skills (via a rich, full project) and demonstrate my capacities.

3) I wanted a platform on which I could explore other ideas. Most notably, extensibility and AI.


I make no claims of the quality of the code or the game/editor. It's big, my first personal project of this size, and it is a learning experience.
